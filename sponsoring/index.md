Hi! We are an open collective, developing modules and tooling for the Puppet ecosystem!

But Vox Pupuli isn't only code to develop and maintain, it's more than that.

Unfortunately a few things costs us money, like:

- Infrastructure for CI/CD
- Participate at conferences
- Merch like stickers! (everyone loves stickers!)
- Sometimes we need a little BBQ and gathering of our community, for the work we love so much!

There are ways to sponsor us:

- [Vox Pupuli on open collective](https://opencollective.com/vox-pupuli)
- [Vox Pupuli on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/voxpupuli)

Or with stuff like:

- Sponsor our CI resources at Hetzner
- Sponsor Swag for conferences
- Sponsor Domain costs at Inwx

If you're interested in these options, please get in touch and email the Project Management Committee at <pmc@voxpupuli.org>.

At the moment we've multiple sponsors via GitHub. In addition to that, multiple
companies sponsor our cloud/CI resources.
