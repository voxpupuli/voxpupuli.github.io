## The first VoxConf is happening!

💡Watch this space for more information soon.
{: class="alert alert-success w-25 callout ms-3"  }

We will do our first conference this July, thanks to NETWAYS generously sponsoring the location.
This will be a single-track half-day conference.
We are sharing the space with the awesome Foreman people celebrating their birthday!
[Their event](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996) takes place in the same location at 1pm so you can attend all their talks as well.

VoxConf is also Hybrid! Grab a ticket [here](https://tickets.netways.de/NES/foremanbirthday/) for VoxConf Online to get a link to the stream.

### Community Meet & Eat by Vox Pupuli

Vox Pupuli will sponsor a Meet & Eat event on the 16th (the evening before the talks).
This will take place at 7PM in the Restaurant [im keller](https://alte-kuechn.de/en/im-keller/).
The address is [Albrecht-Dürer-Straße 3, 90403 Nürnberg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jW3F7pnyeJgEeGnL8).

Nürnberg is a beautiful medieval historic city.
Because of that, we organized a historian who does an exclusive guided city tour.
The tour will start at 5:30PM at [Park Inn Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GzN7oJqAx6gfNSgW8) and end at 7PM at the restaurant (it's basically a long walk through the city).
The city tour is in English, by foot, and free.

### Hotel recommendations

In the past we had a good experience in the [Park Inn Hotel](https://www.radissonhotels.com/de-de/hotels/park-inn-nuernberg).
It's roughly in the middle between the event location and the main train station.
