## The ~~first~~ second VoxConf is happening!

💡Watch this space for more information soon.
{: class="alert alert-success w-25 callout ms-3"  }

As announced during the last Config Management Camp, we will do another conference!
ATIX AG, maintainers of [Orcharhino](https://orcharhino.com/) and long term Foreman contributors, sponsor the location.
Again we partner up with the Foreman community to share a room.
They will celebrate their birthday in the afternoon.

### Community Meet & Eat by Vox Pupuli

Vox Pupuli will sponsor a Meet & Eat event on the 15th (the evening before the talks).
This will take place at 7PM in the Restaurant [Garchinger Augustiner](http://garchinger-augustiner.com/) (with a very nice Biergarten).
The address is [Freisinger Landstraße 4 85748 Garching](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4449167089#map=19/48.250242/11.653418).

Connect with us on our Slack in #voxconf2025 and/or on IRC in #voxpupuli-voxconf2025 (no we won't rename the channels).

### Talks

The call for papers is open! please send your topics for a 25 minutes or 50 minutes slot to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org) by the end of April!

### Recordings & Streaming

Separate recordings and live streaming will be available on media.ccc.de

### Hotel recommendations & travelling

In the past we had a good experience in the [Dorint Hotel München/Garching](https://hotel-muenchen-garching.dorint.com/en/).
It's roughly in the middle between the event location and the main train station.

You can reach Munich by train or international airport (MUC). Garching-Hochbrück is the tram line close to the venue and hotel.

### Travel funding

Since a few years, Vox Pupuli is part of the open source collective and can receive donations.
So far we received over 33,000USD and have 21,000USD in our bank account.

We would like to use a part of that to enable people to attend VoxConf in Munich.

We recognize not everyone is able to make it to an in-person conference but we want to enable as many people as possible to attend the conference.
If we can help you attend, please send a short motivation letter, by the end of 2026-04-30 (UTC), with a rough cost estimation.
We ask you to list the different costs (e.g. flight: X USD, Hotel Y USD) and if you're fine with just parts of it getting sponsored.
Please send it to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).
The PMC will then decide which applicants receive how much funding.
If you've an employer, please ask them if they are interested in co-sponsoring your trip.
Our funding budget is 7,500 USD.
We'll try our best to get as many people to the conference but will take previous contributions into account.
We can only reimburse valid invoices, we cannot book anything on your behalf!
