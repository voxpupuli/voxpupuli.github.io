## The first VoxConf is happening! <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD026 -->

üí°Watch this space for more information soon.
{: class="alert alert-success w-25 callout ms-3"  }

We will do our first conference this July, thanks to NETWAYS generously sponsoring the location.
This will be a single-track half-day conference.
We are sharing the space with the awesome Foreman people celebrating their birthday!
[Their event](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996) takes place in the same location at 1pm so you can attend all their talks as well.

VoxConf is also Hybrid! Grab a ticket [here](https://tickets.netways.de/NES/foremanbirthday/) for VoxConf Online to get a link to the stream.

<a href="https://tickets.netways.de/NES/foremanbirthday/">click here</a> to sign up for our dinner on the 16th, for VoxConf *and* for the Foreman birthday party!

### Community Meet & Eat by Vox Pupuli

Vox Pupuli will sponsor a Meet & Eat event on the 16th (the evening before the talks).
This will take place at 7PM in the Restaurant [im keller](https://alte-kuechn.de/en/im-keller/).
The address is [Albrecht-D√ºrer-Stra√üe 3, 90403 N√ºrnberg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jW3F7pnyeJgEeGnL8).

N√ºrnberg is a beautiful medieval historic city.
Because of that, we organized a historian who does an exclusive guided city tour.
The tour will start at 5:30PM at [Park Inn Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GzN7oJqAx6gfNSgW8) and end at 7PM at the restaurant.
It's a long walk through the city so bring appropriate footwear.
The city tour is in English, by foot, and free.

Connect with us on our Slack in #voxconf2025 and/or on IRC in #voxpupuli-voxconf2025 .

### Hotel recommendations

In the past we had a good experience in the [Park Inn Hotel](https://www.radissonhotels.com/de-de/hotels/park-inn-nuernberg).
It's roughly in the middle between the event location and the main train station.
