Reminiscent of the original Puppet Camps, VoxConf is a one-day single-track meeting of the most active and interesting minds in the Vox Pupuli community.
VoxConf is open to all, whether you are a seasoned contributor or you have yet to make your first pull request.
Whether you want to come learn more about OpenVox, share your own ideas, or help us build the roadmap to the future, we'd love to see you.

## Possible talk topics

- Advances and new ideas in OpenVox
- Free and open source software strategies
- Deploying configuration management
- Project Governance
- Changes in the world of DevOps
- Managing many projects in a cohesive manner
- Exciting new projects people have built

## Updates

- VoxConf '25 has been completed. When the videos are done processing, they'll be posted to its [event page](2025).
- This page will be updated when VoxConf '26 is scheduled.
