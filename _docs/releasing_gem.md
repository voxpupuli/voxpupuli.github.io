title: Releasing a new version of a Ruby Gem

summary: How to perform a complete version release
---

The release process is split into two parts.
Part one can be done by anybody with a GitHub account.
You do not need to be part of the Vox Pupuli GitHub organisation.

## Part 1: Create a 'release pr'

This pull request updates the changelog and bumps the version number to the target version.
The version is set in the gemspec file in the root of the git repository.
Sometimes it's a variable coming from something like `lib/$gem/version.rb`.
An example is [beaker](https://github.com/voxpupuli/beaker/blob/f60ac9413f9c7976a6645ef9e1dd2afbcc6542de/beaker.gemspec#L8), ([version.rb](https://github.com/voxpupuli/beaker/blob/master/lib/beaker/version.rb#L3)).
This can be done from a fork.

Now you can install the changelog generator:

```shell
bundle config set --local path '.vendor/'
bundle config set --local with 'release'
bundle install
```

And in case you installed the gems before:

```shell
bundle install; bundle update; bundle clean
```

We can generate the changelog (in most cases, this requires a [GitHub access token (docs on how to create one)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line): the changelog generator expects the token in the environment variable `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN`).

```shell
CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN='mytoken' bundle exec rake changelog
```

The changelog generator checks for certain labels on closed issues and PRs since the last release and groups them together.
If the changes were neither backwards-incompatible nor only bug fixes, make a minor release.
Check the generated diff for the CHANGELOG.md.
If your chosen release version doesn't match the generated changelog, update gemspec and run the changelog task again.

Get community feedback on the release pr, label it with skip-changelog, get it merged.

## Part 2: Actually create the release

Checkout an updated copy of voxpupuli HEAD branch (main or master).
Do not use a fork here.
Or add voxpupuli as a additional remote to your fork.

with the main repo

```shell
git switch master; git pull origin master
```

with a fork

```shell
git remote add voxpupuli git@github.com:voxpupuli/$my_repo.git
git fetch voxpupuli --tags
git switch master
git pull --rebase voxpupuli master
```

Check with `git tag -l` if the git tags are prefixed with a v or not.
This varies by project (we often adopt gems from other people and don't want to change the versioning scheme in a project).

Create a new git tag with the new version: `git tag -s $version`

Push the git tag:

with main repo:

```shell
git push origin $version
```

with a fork:

```shell
git push voxpupuli $version
```

Then a GitHub action will start to build the gem and publish it to GitHub Packages and RubyGems.org
