# Transferring Gem Ownership on RubyGems.org
This guide explains how to allow VoxPupuli to publish and own the gem on RubyGems.org.

You can add them as owners to an existing gem so they can manage the gem without your interaction.

## Reference

For more information, see the [RubyGems.org guide on managing owners](https://guides.rubygems.org/managing-owners-using-ui/#adding-user-as-an-owner-to-your-gem).

## Adding Owners to an Existing Gem

To add owners to an existing gem head over to RubyGems.org website.

1. Log in to RubyGems.org
2. Navigate to the specific gem's page you want to manage
3. Click on the "Owners" link on the right side of the page
4. Click "Add Owner" and enter `pmc@voxpupuli.org`
5. Select the Owner role:
   - **Owner**: Has full control, including managing other owners
6. The added user will receive a confirmation email and must click the link within 48 hours to confirm ownership

**Note**: The user will still need to confirm the ownership via email after being added.
