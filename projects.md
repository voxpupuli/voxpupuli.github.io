# Projects Overview

Vox Pupuli hosts many projects in the Puppet ecosystem. You're probably already
using several of our modules and our testing pipeline tooling. This page will help
you navigate our GitHub namespace and find just the repository you're looking for.

We'd love to have your help, but please remember to check the [contribution guide](/contributing)
before jumping in!

## Puppet modules

Most of the repositories in our namespace are [Puppet modules]({% include github-repo-search.html topic="puppet" %}).
Most of our modules are also published on the Forge, and these are often the
easiest projects to get involved with.

## Hacktoberfest

During the month of October, we often participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com).
Remember that we have a great number of repositories and so you might have to nudge
developers for a review. Take a look at the [Connect page](/connect) to see all
the ways you can engage with us and work through your contributions. Read more about
the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) project to see how it works.
