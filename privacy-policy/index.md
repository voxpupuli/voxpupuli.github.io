# How and why we use your data

## The website

The Vox Pupuli website is a static site that does not track, collect, or store 
infromation or set cookies. There is no account needed or required to access 
the website itself. The website itself is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
and any data gathered by Github will adhere to the [Github Privacy Policy](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

The website uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for securing the
communication to the Vox Pupuli website.

The website does host a community run Blog series and may have the 
author's name be visible in the blog post indefinitely.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest
 

## The codebases

The Vox Pupuli community uses [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage the code 
that comprises the various Puppet modules, plugins, tools, and RubyGems the 
community is responsible for maintaining. Refer to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/)
for information on how GitHub handles the data you post there. We also use 
non-identifiable data from the codebases to provide aggregated statistics such 
as total member count, number of open PRs, total number of projects, etc.

Please note that due to the open source nature of the community, we may retain 
limited personally-identifiable data indefinitely.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest

The codebases also connect to a variety of external services for testing code,
tracking issues/pull requests, GitHub notification management, etc:

* Automated Testing and Code Quality
  * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
  * [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/)
  * [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/)
  * [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
  * [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
* Project and Ticket Management
  * [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
  * [Zube](https://zube.io/)
* GitHub notification Management
  * [Octobox](https://octobox.io/)
* Documentation Hosting
  * [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)

As these tools work in conjunction with our GitHub organization and Source Code
repositories, they will have access to any public data that is stored in
your GitHub account and/or the source code. Please be sure to read the Privacy 
Policy for each tool above to see what they use that data for.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, Consent

## Communication

The Vox Pupuli project maintains three public IRC channels on 
[Freenode](https://freenode.net), refer to [Freenode's privacy policy](https://freenode.net/policies#privacy-policy-and-data-retention)
for details on how they handle your data. Our bot keeps a rolling backlog in 
the IRC channel for logging purposes that is rolled off after 10 minutes. 
However, due to the open nature of the IRC protocol, other users can
log channel data outside of the control of the community.

The Vox Pupuli community also uses a mailing list via the 
[Groups.io](https://groups.io) website. When signing up for a Groups.io 
account, you provide an E-Mail address and password. The email address is used
to log into the web interface for the mailing list and to send updates to your 
mailing list topics, personal messages from other users, and summaries. You have 
full control over the emails sent from your Groups.io account preferences. 
Please see the [Groups.io Privacy Policy](https://groups.io/static/privacy) on 
any additional data usage relating to your account.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, Consent
