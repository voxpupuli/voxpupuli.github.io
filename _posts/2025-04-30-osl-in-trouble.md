Have you been looking at the OpenVox project and wondered what you could do to
help out? What if I told you about an opportunity to help us, and also hundreds
of other OSS projects that you probably rely on? The [OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org)
is OpenVox's primary package host and helped us get the project off the
ground right from the start. They help hundreds of open source projects with
critical infrastructure needs that many projects (like us) would not have been
able to afford on their own.

Not only that, but they have been training the next generation of FOSS DevOps
and system infrastructure engineers for YEARS. Many of the first Puppet community
practitioners came up through the OSL. They contributed many of the first Puppet
modules. The venerable [Pro Puppet](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pro-puppet-second/9781430260400/)
second edition was written by OSL students in collaboration with PuppetLabs
developers, including myself.

OSL has played a HUGE part in Puppet's story and helped Puppet, Vox Pupuli, and
OpenVox get to where they are today. I'd wager that your company uses OSL resources
on a regular basis and may not even realize it.

However, with the current crisis in academic funding in the USA, they are in
critical need of funding and without your help, they may cease to exist. See
[this blog post for more information](https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/) and
go talk to your boss today! Don't hesitate to
[drop them some cash yourself if you can spare it](https://osuosl.org/donate/).
