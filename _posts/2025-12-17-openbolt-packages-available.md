We are happy to announce the availability of the first **OpenBolt** packages!

**OpenBolt** is the community-maintained open-source implementation of the **Bolt** orchestration tool.
It is intended to be a drop-in replacement, just like the **OpenVox Agent** is a drop-in replacement for the **Puppet Agent**.

.deb and .rpm packages should already be on a mirror near you.
If you have already [configured the OpenVox repositories](/openvox/install/), installing `openbolt` is as easy as:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install openbolt
```

Running on a Mac?
You are covered, head to https://downloads.voxpupuli.org/mac/openvox8/ to grab the package.

Windows packages are not ready yet, as they offer more challenges.
If you want to help with those, [reach out](/connect)!
