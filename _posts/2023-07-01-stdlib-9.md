Starting Today, 2023-07-01, we are implementing puppetlabs/stdlib 9 support in our
modules. The 9 release dropped a lot of functions or namespaced them. Wherever
necessary, we will require puppetlabs/stdlib 9. In those cases we will do a
major release of the module. We will try to combine this with the major release
required for dropping Puppet 6 support.

All modules that depend on stdlib 9.x will receive a PR with the title `puppetlabs/stdlib: Require 9.x`.
As modules are made compatible with stdlib 9.x will recieve a PR with the title `puppetlabs/stdlib: Allow 9.x`.
