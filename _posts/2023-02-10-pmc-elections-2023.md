As announced at CfgMgmtCamp this week, we are kicking off the "annual" PMC elections
process. For an increasingly loose definition of the word, this is a yearly process to
provide more people opportunities to get involved with our leadership and decision making.

Would you like to help set roadmap or help architect our module deprecation policy? Do
you want to help organize events or run social media? Maybe you'd like to help curate
our blog or source content from fresh writers.

Maybe you just want to get involved and help out with whatever is needed. Joining the
PMC is your avenue to this involvement.

Starting today, you may nominate yourself or someone else for the elections. Nominations
are open until *March 22 2023 23:59 UTC* and then we'll vote to select the 5 new members
of the PMC.

See the [elections page in our plumbing repository](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01.md)
for nomination instructions.

I'll be your elections officer this year. I hope to see your PR soon, and I've got a
Vox hoodie for the first person to submit a nomination.

Thanks!
