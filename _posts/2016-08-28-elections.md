Vox Pupuli is about to live its first elections. This blogpost will give you the
context and how to become a candidate.

> Vox Pupuli is a collective of Puppet module, tooling and documentation authors

Vox Pupuli now represents 68 collaborators, and 93 repositories. In order to
make this project successful in the long term, we have been [discussing][d]
about how we can better work together and take appropriate decisions.

Open-Source Communities nowadays gain a lot from having a structure that can
take action when bad things happens, and also when improvement is needed. We
already have a [Code of Conduct][coc] in place, but we obviously need to ensure
it is respected.

On August 22, after abut 2 months of discussions, we merged the [Governance
Document][gd]. It describes the responsibilities of the actors of Vox Pupuli:
Users, Collaborators, Contributors… and it describes a Committee, the Project
Management Committee (PMC).

TL;DR The Committees members are elected by the community for 1 year. They take
care of the Code of Conduct and its values, participate in strategic planning,
amongst other things.

In normal times, the PMC would elect an Election Officer to run the elections,
as stated in the [Governance Document][gd]. However, to bootstrap the first
elections, two members have volunteered to do that task:
[Daniele "daenney" Sluijters][daenney] and [Julien "roidelapluie" Pivotto][me].
I will take care of collecting the candidatures and promote the elections, while
Daniele will run the actual elections.

You can find more information [here][e], including how to become a candidate.
Detailed information will be spread soon of this website too. Here is the
timeline:

* Before *September 17 2016 23:59UTC*: Accepting candidatures
* Between *September 18 2016 12:00UTC* and *September 28 2016 12:00UTC*: Vote

Please enjoy the party, and let's gather as much participation as possible
during the whole election process!
