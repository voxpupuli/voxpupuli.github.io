Today, 2023-07-02, we started to implement Puppet 8 support for our modules.
This has a few constraints:

* Puppet 8 AIO packages bundle Ruby 3.2
* because of that, rspec-puppet unit tests for Puppet 8 run on Ruby 3.2
* To implement Ruby 3.2 support in our test suite, we had to drop Ruby < 2.7 in some gems
* Puppet 6 AIO packages bundle Ruby 2.5

Conclusion: we have to drop Puppet 6 before we can add Puppet 8 support.

[modulesync_config 6](https://github.com/voxpupuli/modulesync_config/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600-2023-05-12)
will bring the required changes to our modules to pull in Gems that work on Ruby
3.2. In most modules it's enough to add Puppet 8 to the metadata.json. That will
run all unit and acceptance tests on Puppet 8.
