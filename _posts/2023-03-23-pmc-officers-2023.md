Well, *[[checks watch]]* would ya look at that. It's March 23, UTC, and that means that it's time to close the [PMC elections](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2023/02/10/pmc-elections-2023/). Not only that but as it turns out, we had precisely five nominations which is the number of open positions. Y'all are making my job as the elections officer way too easy this time around!

[Martin](https://github.com/tuxmea) was the first to submit a nomination, and as promised Puppet will be sending him a brand spankin' fresh hoodie as soon as we've got the new design finalized.

## Let's get to it and meet your new PMC members

![bastelfreak's GitHub profile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p64bmp3qc4pli0as4u6h.png) No surprise to anyone, first up is Tim Muesel, known as [`bastelfreak`](https://github.com/bastelfreak) to many. One of the most prolific contributors in the Puppet community, Tim's tireless energy is an inspiration to all of us. [Read his nomination](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01/bastelfreak.md).

![smortex's GitHub profile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lrhmr730lfi8urc1lkku.png) Next up is Romain Tarti√®re, also known as [`smortex`](https://github.com/smortex). Romain has been maintaining the FreeBSD Puppet port for so long that he's seen three major Puppet versions go EOL. [Read his nomination](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01/smortex.md).

![rwaffen's GitHub profile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7g0w9mjlrso90eatubsg.png) Then we have Robert Waffen, also known as [`rwaffen`](https://github.com/rwaffen). Robert came to the Puppet community and then to Vox Pupuli in the same way that many do--by exploration and debugging and little fixes and then realizing just how much of an impact all his little fixes cumulatively added up to. We're grateful to have Robert and people like him with us. [Read his nomination](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01/rwaffen.md).

![sebastianrakel's GitHub profile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgom7pj6o5dx2ktfbihm.png) [Sebastian Rakel](https://github.com/sebastianrakel) is active in both the Vox Pupuli and the Arch Linux communities. Not only is he a diligent pull request reviewer, but he also knows how to make communities valuable for all of us. [Read his nomination](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01/spritzgebaeck.md).

![ekohl's GitHub profile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kg9jac8h4fha777h5vw4.png) Ewoud Kohl van Wijngaarden, also known as [`ekohl`](https://github.com/ekohl), is one of the most knowledgeable people in the Puppet community. Not only that, but he's very helpful and always ready to share that expertise. I always pay extra attention to his PR reviews. [Read his nomination](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2023-01/ewoud.md).

## What's next?

Over the next few days, the new PMC officers will be onboarded and the website updated. They'll select also select members to fill a couple specialized roles.

* The *security officer* is the point of contact for external or internal security issues. This person has a published gpg key, and will be the main point of contact for CVE numbers and such
* The *communications officer* is the main point of contact for external and internal publicity and marketing efforts and requests.
