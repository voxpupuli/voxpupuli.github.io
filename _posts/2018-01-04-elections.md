Vox Pupuli now represents 71 collaborators, and 143 repositories. In order to make this project successful in the long term, we elect a list of PMC officers to make big decisions and guide the organization in the right direction. This is all laid out in the [governance document][g].

TL;DR The Committees members are elected by the community for 1 year. They take care of the Code of Conduct and its values, participate in strategic planning, amongst other things.

Open-Source Communities nowadays gain a lot from having a structure that can take action when bad things happens, and also when improvement is needed. We already have a [Code of Conduct][coc] in place, but we obviously need to ensure it is respected.

The PMC has set [Spencer Krum][sk] to be the Election Officer and to run the elections, as stated in the [Governance Document][gd]. Spencer is not running for PMC re-election.

You can find more information [here][e], including how to become a candidate.
