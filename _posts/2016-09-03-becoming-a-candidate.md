What a time to be alive in the Vox Pupuli community! As [more][r1], [more][r2]
and [more][r3] repositories join [our namespace][n] (welcome!), our community now
counts 70 members.

Such a group of people working together faces important challenges, towards
integration of new members, general guidance, interpersonal conflicts... And
while it is hard to avoid those problems, a community organize itself in a way
that the resolution of those problems can be found as soon as possible.

That is one of the tasks of the [Project Management Committee (PMC)][g]. Such a
committee is important for all of us -- it is meant to be able to move forward,
taking decisions, and ensuring that this community keeps working on the
technical side, by making Vox Pupuli [a great place to work for everyone][c].

We need *you* to be part of this committee. Are you a dev, a sysadmin, a user,
contributor or not, collaborator or not… everyone is welcome and can take
her/his chance to run in this election. To do this, add yourself to [that
list][e]. Optionally you can have one markdown page as well describing more in
details who you are and everything you want -- the only limitation is that it
follows [our rules][c].

Don't be shy. There are 5 places available on that committee and we will ensure
that everyone gets the same chance. By randomizing the order of the candidates
in the website and during the election, by promoting every candidate at the same
level. Because that election must [reflect the values we all defend][c]. The
values of a fair, welcoming and open world.

You can become a candidate until September 17 2016 23:59 UTC. Soon after that,
the list of candidates will be available on the website.

Vox Pupuli needs candidates like you!
