Since [Configuration Management Camp 2023](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/), people can
finally donate to Vox Pupuli!

This was an idea started by nibalizer, meena and daenny in ~ 2015. We wanted to
join the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/). That
didn't work out in the end, for various reasons. Instead, bastelfreak tried to
bring us into the [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/)
organisation. That failed due to paperwork (like actual paper that has to be
sent across the world).

Now after many years, we're part of the
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vox-pupuli). We didn't really know
what to expect and bastelfreak created some random tiers at GitHub sponsors:

[github.com/sponsors/voxpupuli](https://github.com/sponsors/voxpupuli)

Now a few months later we can say: What the hell?!

People are sending us roughly $200 per month!

It's amazing to see the support from so many individuals and companies. We want
to point out [Steffen 'saz' Zieger](https://github.com/saz), he was our first
sponsor! You might know him from his awesome
[saz/ssh module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/saz/ssh).

We promised all bigger sponsors a place on our website (well, bastelfreak did
that). Now we've so many of them, that we had to adjust our design a
[few times](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli.github.io/pull/306).

Check out [voxpupuli.org/sponsoring](https://voxpupuli.org/sponsoring/) to learn
who is sponsoring us with money or CI resources and to learn how you can support
us!

We're so grateful for all of our supporters who enable us to keep the puppet
community up and running <3
