Hello everyone!

If you're planning on attending the Puppet Contributor Summit this year June 4-5th, then I'm excited to announce that Vox Pupuli will be hosting a social event on June 3rd, 2019 at the Budapest [Pinball Museum](http://www.flippermuzeum.hu/en/) for all attendees to come enjoy some food/drinks and get to know your fellow attendees.

It's too early to announce times and what else to expect, but stay tuned, we'll have more information in the coming weeks.

Have a great week!
David Hollinger
