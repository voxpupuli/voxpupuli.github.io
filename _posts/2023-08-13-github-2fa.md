GitHub will soon enforce two factor authentication for all users in our
organisation. Most of you already have it enabled. Instead of being locked out
of our organisation, please enable 2FA!

GitHub announced the 2FA expansion last year:

[github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-developer-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/](https://github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-developer-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/)

And the rollout started for some groups in March and will continue until the end of the year:
