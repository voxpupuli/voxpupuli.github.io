Hello everybody!
A long long time ago, we started to
[drop Puppet 3](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2016/12/22/putting-down-puppet-3/).
During that process, we created a legacy branch, called `puppet3`. Puppet 3 is
end of life since a long time. We will purge those branches during the next
cleanup phase.

Sales pitch: We've a cool new blog series where we honour cool contributions,
[check it out!](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2019/01/14/code-of-the-week/). Did
you spot some cool code as well? Write a
[short blogpost](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli.github.io/tree/master/_posts)
or write an email to our
[Project Management committee](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org) or just drop a note on
our IRC channel #voxpupuli on [Libera](https://web.libera.chat/?#voxpupuli).
