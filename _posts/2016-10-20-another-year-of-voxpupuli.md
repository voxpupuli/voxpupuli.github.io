It's been one more year of VoxPupuli goodness. We thought we'd look back on what we've accomplished this year and celebrate. This year we solidified our identity and, of course, released a ton of good code. We added a lot of new people and repositories to our organization, too.

Important things we accomplished this year:

* [Renamed to Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2016/01/01/voxpupuli/)
* Added a self-governance [document](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/governance.md)
* Elected the first steering [committee](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2016/10/12/pmc-election-results/)
* Added 22 modules
* Released 240 things (modules, gems etc) (this really means we created 240 tags)
* Added merge commit rights for 44 people (this really means we made 44 unique 'add privleges' actions on github teams)
* Created voxpupuli.org/plugins as a yellow pages for puppet tooling and plugins
* [Octohatrack](https://github.com/labhr/octohatrack) found 2521 unique contributors to our projects (all time)
* Began tracing our activity in a [changelog](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Thanks everyone who has been a part of this!

We'd like to give a special thanks to Daenney and Roidelap1uie for stepping up to run our election.
