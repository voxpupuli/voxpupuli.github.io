A new year, a new name and a new website. A lot has happened for our pet
project this year. Many new contributors and code joined our organisation
but the biggest debacle was the big rename.

Because of legal issues and no one being able to predict the future we had
to change the name from Puppet Community. It also confused the heck out of
everyone.

We've now settled on Vox Pupuli, "voice of puppets" and as we enter 2016
the big rename is ongoing. IRC has already been moved over and soon our
website and Github namespace will change too.
