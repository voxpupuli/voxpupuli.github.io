Vox Pupuli dropped support for EL7 distros in the modules a long time ago.
When we started the OpenVoxProject, we added EL7 packages to enable people an easier migration from the dead Perforce open source packages to the OpenVoxProject.
Regular EL7 support is dead in all the different distributions.
Also EL8, EL9 and EL10 are available since a long time.
Because of that, OpenVoxProject will publish a final round of EL7 packages with the OpenVox agent 8.24.0 release this year.
Afterwards we will stop maintaining it, unless someone is willing to sponsor the maintenance (see [our support page](https://voxpupuli.org/openvox/support/)).

We will continue Amazon Linux 2 packages until it's EoL in 2026-06-30.
