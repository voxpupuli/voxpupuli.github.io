title: Installing OpenVox
subsection: openvox

OpenVox package downloads are currently sponsored by [Overlook InfraTech](https://overlookinfratech.com).
As of release 8.11, OpenVox is functionally equivalent to Puppet; the command names are the same, the configuration file paths are the same, etc.
The major differences are in help text output, man pages, and so on.
This means that you can continue to use all the commands, modules, tooling, etc that you're used to, but at this time *you cannot install both Puppet and OpenVox on the same system*.

ðŸš¨ Before you enable and install the packages, be forewarned that these are still experimental packages only.
We do not yet have a fully robust test pipeline, although that is our next priority.


## Uninstalling Puppet

We encourage you to try out OpenVox on a fresh test system, the way you would for any major system package.
If you'd rather try it on an existing system or develop a migration process, then you will first have to uninstall Puppet.

You do not need to purge configuration files because OpenVox will continue to use them as they are.
However, **before getting started on the migration you should strongly consider backing up the entire `/etc/puppetlabs/` tree** in case of accidents.

* If you're migrating from Puppet Enterprise you can use the `puppet-enterprise-uninstaller` script on each node as described in [their docs](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/uninstalling.html).
* If you're using the all-in-one packages such as `puppet-agent` or `puppetserver` from the `[apt|yum].puppet.com` repos, simply remove these packages.
* If you're using distro provided packages, then you might have a bigger job.
  For example, if you're using Debian packages, you may have several Puppet modules packaged as `.deb` packages that you'll have to move to your `Puppetfile`.
  You might consider waiting until your distro packages OpenVox.
    * If you do want to migrate now, then remove any puppet packages and dependencies you have installed using your distro tools.
        * Debian family
          * `apt autoremove <packagename>`
        * RedHat family
          * `yum autoremove <packagename>`
    * You might also consider (carefully) cleaning up unused dependencies afterwards by running `apt` or `yum` autoremove without a package name.

You do not need to remove the `[apt|yum].puppet.com` repositories although the only thing you'll be able to use them for going forward is installing historical Puppet releases.


## Installation

First enable the repository, based on your Linux distribution.
Choose the appropriate `openvox8-release` repo package from either of these locations and install it.

* Debian family:
  * [https://apt.overlookinfratech.com](https://apt.overlookinfratech.com)
* RedHat family:
  * [https://yum.overlookinfratech.com](https://yum.overlookinfratech.com)
 

Then install the packages you want.

* Debian family
  * `apt install openvox-agent`
  * `apt install openvox-server`
  * `apt install openvoxdb`
* RedHat family
  * `yum install openvox-agent`
  * `yum install openvox-server`
  * `yum install openvoxdb`

If you have backed up config files, then restore them now.

### Example (Yum)
```
curl -LO https://s3.osuosl.org/openvox-yum/GPG-KEY-openvox.pub
rpm -Uvh https://s3.osuosl.org/openvox-yum/openvox8-release-el-10.noarch.rpm
yum install openvox-server
```
