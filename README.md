## Building this site

- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve -w --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml`

You can also use the rake tasks defined in the `Rakefile`:

- `build`: `jekyll build`
- `validate`: uses html-proofer to check the generated site
- `clean`: removes the `./_site` directory Jekyll generated

## Puppet Plugins

Tools and plugins that appear on the Plugins page of our site
are defined in the `_data/tools` directory. Tools without plugins are going to
be listed in the table under the `Tools` header. Tools with plugins will have
their own header and table listing the plugins defined for that tool.

### Tool definition format

There's a single hash in each tool's definition that describes the tool and
optionally contains an array of plugins that can be used with that tool. A tool
that doesn't have any plugins will be listed in the table under the Tools header
while a tool that does have plugins will have its own header and a table listing
all plugins in the tool's `plugins` array.

#### Tool Schema

| Key            | Value Data Type | Required or Optional |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`         | String          | Required             |
| `display_name` | String          | Required             |
| `url`          | String          | Required             |
| `description`  | String          | Required             |
| `plugins`      | Array           | Optional             |

#### Plugin Schema

| Key            | Value Data Type | Required or Optional |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`         | String          | Required             |
| `url`          | String          | Required             |
| `description`  | String          | Required             |

### What's a tool vs. a plugin

The difference can be kind of fluid, so I figured it would be helpful to define
plugin and tool.

A *plugin* cannot generally be used independent of another tool. Plugins add
functionality to another tool. An example of a plugin is `beaker-libvirt`
because it enables libvirt as a hypervisor in Beaker.

A *tool* can generally be used independent of another specific tool or it is a
tool that has plugins itself. An example of a tool is `rspec-puppet` because it
has plugins. Another example of a tool is `modulesync` because it can be used
independent of another tool.

## Contribution

We happily accept contributions of all kind. Did you spot a typo somewhere? Did
you do a talk about Vox Pupuli that you would like to link to? Do you want to
write a plog post?

Feel free to send us a pull request with your changes or raise an [issue](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli.github.io/issues/new).
We currently require all commits in this repo to be signed, so please configure your git client properly.
Let us know if you need some help.
We're also reachable via our [IRC and Slack channels](https://voxpupuli.org/connect/).

We test if the pages still build properly via github actions, and generate a preview zip
bundle that reviewers can use to verify changes. You can run this locally
by running `bundle exec rake test` and `bundle exec rake build`.

## Writing docs

Docs can have the following header:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Deprecated and Archived Modules
date: 2019-11-29
summary: Vox Pupuli policy on deprecating and archiving modules
github_username: binford2k
last_updater: bastelfreak
---
```

- `title` will be used in the URL + in the header
- `date` is assumed as the date of publishing
- `summary` is a short roundup used on the navigation page
- `github_username` the GitHub username of the original author, optional attribute
- `last_update` the GitHub username of the author from the last update, optional attribute (if it was updated is determined by Jekyll automatically)
